```text
{
  "type": "skill_listing",
  "content": "- agentic-user-journey-testing: Use when validating app, UI, or product-surface work through the running app, especially when logs/tests pass but a user job may still be blocked or unclear\n- brainstorming: Use before substantial product, UI, feature, or behavior work with ambiguity, user-journey impact, or multiple plausible approaches\n- building-react-apps: Use when building, refactoring, planning, or debugging React or Next.js apps, React components, hooks, routing, frontend state, SSR, hydration, bundles, imports, or UI settings\n- client-server-state-invariants: Use when planning, building, reviewing, or debugging React apps with server state, optimistic UI, caches, polling, SSE/WebSocket streams, background jobs, persistence, or client/server synchronization\n- designing-settings-dialogs: Use when designing, planning, building, or reviewing settings dialogs, settings dialogues, preferences panels, configuration modals, option tabs, or UI settings surfaces\n- dispatching-parallel-agents: Use when facing 2+ independent tasks that can be worked on without shared state or sequential dependencies\n- executing-plans: Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute inline with review checkpoints\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill.\n- implementing-react-i18n: Use when adding, fixing, or reviewing React internationalization, language selectors, locale resources, translated UI copy, or bugs where changing language does not update user-facing strings\n- improve: Survey any codebase as a senior advisor and produce prioritized, self-contained implementation plans for OTHER models/agents to execute. Strictly read-only on source code — never implements, fixes, or refactors anything itself. Use when asked to audit a codebase, find improvement opportunities (bugs, security, performance, test coverage, tech debt, migrations, DX), suggest features or where to take the project next (roadmap, product direction), or generate handoff plans for another agent to implement.\n- instrumenting-control-planes: Use when building, planning, reviewing, or debugging apps with backend decisions, agent workflows, long-running jobs, SSE/WebSocket streams, recovery paths, deletes, retries, or user-visible failures\n- learning-from-bugs: Use when a meaningful bug, regression, architecture flaw, storage issue, memory problem, persistence failure, control-plane failure, or system-level failure has been diagnosed or fixed\n- optimizing-react-next-apps: Use when a React or Next.js app feels slow, cluttered, overbundled, slow to compile, slow to load, ineffective at SSR, hydration-heavy, or likely burdened by unnecessary imports or UI dependencies\n- receiving-code-review: Use when receiving code review feedback, before implementing suggestions, especially if feedback seems unclear or technically questionable - requires technical rigor and verification, not performative agreement or blind implementation\n- requesting-code-review: Use when completing tasks, implementing major features, or before merging to verify work meets requirements\n- second-opinion: Use when writing or hardening substantial specs, implementation plans, architecture plans, design plans, or unusually hard creative decisions before execution\n- subagent-driven-development: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session\n- systematic-debugging: Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes\n- test-driven-development: Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code\n- using-ultrapowers: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring skill invocation before acting\n- verification-before-completion: Use when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, before committing or creating PRs - requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims; evidence before assertions always\n- writing-plans: Use when you have an approved spec or clear requirements for a multi-step task, before implementation\n- writing-skills: Use when creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment\n- sloptrim:sloptrim: Use when the user wants to humanize text, trim slop, de-AI or de-slop writing, remove AI tells, fix robotic or ChatGPT-sounding prose, or make writing sound human and natural. Also run before delivering a CV, cover letter, email, report, or essay to be sent. Removes 71 documented AI-writing patterns with a local detector, preserves numbers, names and citations, and rebuilds toward a human voice rather than a flat husk. Mode-aware, so it never fabricates voice on factual content.\n- dataviz: Use this skill whenever you are about to create ANY chart, graph, plot, dashboard, or data visualization, in ANY output medium — an HTML or React artifact, inline SVG, plotting code in any library (matplotlib, plotly, d3, Recharts, …), an image/PNG you will render and upload, or a chart shared into Slack. Read it BEFORE writing the first line of chart code, choosing chart colors, building a stat tile / meter / KPI row, or laying out a dashboard. Produces visualizations that read as one system — elegant, accessible, consistent in light and dark — using a brand-neutral placeholder palette you swap for your own. Teaches a design-system-agnostic method: a form heuristic, a color formula with a runnable validator, mark specs, and interaction rules. A validated default palette is documented in `references/palette.md` — swap that file's values for your brand's. Triggers on: \"chart\", \"graph\", \"plot\", \"data viz\", \"visualization\", \"dashboard\", \"analytics\", \"visualize data\", \"categorical colors\", \"sequential / diverging palette\", \"stat tile\", \"sparkline\", \"heatmap\", \"legend\", \"axis\", \"tooltip\", \"chart colors\", \"color by series\".\n- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors (\"from now on when X\", \"each time X\", \"whenever X\", \"before/after X\") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions (\"allow X\", \"add permission\", \"move permission to\"), env vars (\"set X=Y\"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: \"allow npm commands\", \"add bq permission to global settings\", \"move permission to user settings\", \"set DEBUG=true\", \"when claude stops show X\". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.\n- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: \"rebind ctrl+s\", \"add a chord shortcut\", \"change the submit key\", \"customize keybindings\".\n- code-review: Review the current diff, or a PR number/branch/path target, for correctness bugs and reuse/simplification/efficiency cleanups at the given effort level (low/medium: fewer, high-confidence findings; high→max: broader coverage, may include uncertain findings; ultra: deep multi-agent review in the cloud); with no level given, it reuses the level you typed last. Pass --comment to post findings as inline PR comments, or --fix to apply the findings to the working tree after the review. For ultra on a GitHub.com PR target, --post asks to post the finished review’s findings to the PR as a single comment from the user’s GitHub account (not a review; the launch dialog still confirms in interactive sessions, while non-interactive mode posts on the flag alone) and --no-post hides that option.\n- simplify: Review the changed code for reuse, simplification, efficiency, and altitude cleanups, then apply the fixes. Quality only — it does not hunt for bugs; use /code-review for that.\n- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.\n- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (e.g. \"check the deploy every 5 minutes\", \"keep running /babysit-prs\"). Do NOT invoke for one-off tasks.\n- schedule: Create, update, list, or run scheduled cloud agents (routines) that execute on a cron schedule. - When the user wants to schedule a recurring cloud agent, set up automated tasks, create a cron job for Claude Code, or manage their scheduled agents/routines. Also use when the user wants a one-time scheduled run (\"run this once at 3pm\", \"remind me to check X tomorrow\").\n- claude-api: Reference for the Claude API / Anthropic SDK — model ids, pricing, params, streaming, tool use, MCP, agents, caching, token counting, model migration.\nTRIGGER — read BEFORE opening the target file; don't skip because it \"looks like a one-liner\" — whenever: the prompt names Claude/Anthropic in any form (Claude, Anthropic, Fable, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, `anthropic`, `@anthropic-ai`, `claude-*`, `us.anthropic.*`, `[1m]`); the user asks about an LLM (pricing/model choice/limits/caching) — never answer from memory; OR the task is LLM-shaped with provider unstated (agent/MCP/tool-definition/multi-agent/RAG/LLM-judge/computer-use; generate/summarize/extract/classify/rewrite/converse over NL; debugging refusals/cutoffs/streaming/tool-calls/tokens).\nSKIP only when another provider is being worked on (overrides all triggers): OpenAI/GPT/Gemini/Llama/Mistral/Cohere/Ollama named in the query; OR `grep -rE 'openai|langchain_openai|google.generativeai|genai|mistralai|cohere|ollama'` over the project hits (run this grep FIRST if no provider named — don't Read the file).\n- run: Launch and drive this project's app to see a change working. Use when asked to run, start, or screenshot the app, or to confirm a change works in the real app (not just tests). First looks for a project skill that already covers launching the app; otherwise falls back to built-in patterns per project type (CLI, server, TUI, Electron, browser-driven, library).\n- init: Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation\n- security-review: Complete a security review of the pending changes on the current branch",
